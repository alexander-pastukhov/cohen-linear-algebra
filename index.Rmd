# Introduction {-}

This is an R-version of the code for ["Linear Algebra: Theory, Intuition, Code"](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Theory-Intuition-Code/dp/9083136604) by [Mike X Cohen](http://www.mikexcohen.com/). I have tried to keep the code as close as possible to the original. Instead of importing libraries, I use `library::` disambiguation to make it easier to understand which function belongs to which package.
