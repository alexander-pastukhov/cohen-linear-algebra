# Introduction {-}

This is an R-version of the code for ["Linear Algebra: Theory, Intuition, Code"](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Theory-Intuition-Code/dp/9083136604) by [Mike X Cohen](http://www.mikexcohen.com/). I have tried to keep the code as close as possible to the original even if it went against the spirit of R. E.g., loops can be replaced with vectorized operations, tidyverse piping approach, or `apply()`/`purrr::map()`. In most cases, I use `library::` disambiguation to make it easier to understand which function belongs to which package, instead of importing libraries via `library()`.
